Stock Tracker
-------------
Tracks stocks and will let you group them together.

Should have:
- Text box that will search for a ticker
- Area for chart
- Place to add multiple tickers
- Be able to turn off and on lines
- Group tickers together to see their performance

### Plans

Version 1:
- Search bar for ticker
- Chart for ticker data

Version 2:
- Set up Redux for one ticker's data
- Have Column to store past searches
- Store data for multiple tickers

Version 3:
- Have Different Time periods
- Option to Normalize Data (just view percentage)
- Have different colors
